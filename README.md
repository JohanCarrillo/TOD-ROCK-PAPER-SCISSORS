# TOD-ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS
This project was proposed at The Odin Project to put in practice the acquired 
abilites in javascript. I found it boring to do a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors
game so I changed it a bit with a cat's topic I found more interesting.

### Learned outcomes:
The most interesting thing I learned here is that even if a eventLinstener is 
used inside a function, the event will remain even if the execution of the
function ends.
I also learned to hide and show parts of the webpage by changing the display 
attribute.
I practiced the basic DOM manipulation using scripts.
